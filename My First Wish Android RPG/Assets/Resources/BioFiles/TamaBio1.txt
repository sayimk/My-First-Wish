Tama's First Friend:She and Neru met Elliot and Akira in a park in front of their house at the age of 4, when she followed her big sister. She was shy in front of the Akira at first, but quickly opened up to him on the first day of meeting him when he started to talk to her kindly and was very patient with her.
