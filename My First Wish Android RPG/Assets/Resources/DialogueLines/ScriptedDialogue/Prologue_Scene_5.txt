Tama:What is this thing anyways?. I've seen quiet a few of them around this place, they look like some sort of crystal?
Akira:Tama, do you know what this place is called, I think i mentioned it on the way here.
Tama:Nope! (Smiles).
Neru:ha-ha-ha. That's my sister for you.
Akira:hahaha.
Elliot:This forest is said to have many aqua coloured crystal scattered around, these crystal apparently are called Azur Crystals.
Neru:Thats right. From what I've read about them from that old explorers logs is that these crystal are able to produce and radiate large amount of energy in the form of this blue-ish light. Might not look like much, but if used properly, estimated they would be able to power a whole city.
Tama:ooooo, A whole city, huh. I'm surprised that no body has come to collect them.
Akira:That's what I thought was weird when Neru told me as well. So I looked into it a little bit with her, you won't guess what we found.
Tama:?
Neru:There were several large companies that tried. But they weren't able to get into the forest, they came but this fog apparently got even thicker and they ended up at the entrance again.
Akira:From what I've heard, you can't even see it from above, it's just fog.
Tama:whaaa?, that's kind of creepy. Why did we co-.
Elliot:I think you already know why we came to this place, that is called the Crystal Forest.
Tama:I know, I also don't regret it. If it's for Big brother Aki, then I'll come here a thousand times.
Neru:All three of us would.
Akira:(Thanks you three, you don't know how much this means to me).
