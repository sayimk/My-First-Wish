Elliot:Did you find anything interesting in that chest?
Akira:Just a black sword and a few potion vials.
Tama:What kind of sword and was it nice?
Akira:This one here, seems to be a type of Katana.
Neru:Then you should probably keep hold of it, I think it will suit you best because of your experience with that kind of sword.
Elliot:Yeh, Nerus right, means we will be relying on you if we run into trouble.
Tama:Ehehe.
Akira:(sigh) Okay.(I still think we should have brought our weapons when we set out for this place).
