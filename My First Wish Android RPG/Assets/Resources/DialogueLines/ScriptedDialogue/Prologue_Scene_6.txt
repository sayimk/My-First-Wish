Elliot:I think this is it.
Neru:The entrance to the tower, right.
Elliot:Yes, I have no idea whats inside, other than the fact that there has only been a hand full of people who have tried to enter.
Tama:El, that happened to them?.
Elliot:Only 2 people came back from what I heard.
Neru:I looked into it and they BOTH were in comatose, I couldn't believe it.
Tama:I couldn't believe it when you told us sis. I think you also said 7 or 8 people tried to enter within the last 10 years.
Neru:Yes, 4 years ago apparently 2 people went missing, it was speculated that they entered here. But last year, locals found the exact same 2 unconscious just at the entrance of this forest.
Elliot:Those two where unconscious for about 3 days at the hospital in the capital, but then entered a coma, right.
Neru:Yes, I was in the hospital discussing something with group of doctors there, when my discussion was cut interrupted due to the panic of those 2 entering a comatose state. 
Tama:Wow. Also I was wondering where you went the other day.
Akira:(I'm a little worried about doing this on a whole, but the three wouldn't listen and are so persist).
Elliot:We're not going to get anywhere by just standing here. Lets go.
Neru & Tama:Yup.
Akira:Okay.
